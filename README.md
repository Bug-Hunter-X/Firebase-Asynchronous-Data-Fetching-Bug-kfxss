# Firebase Asynchronous Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase related to asynchronous data fetching using the `once()` method. The primary issue is that code following the `once()` call may execute before the asynchronous data retrieval completes, resulting in undefined values being used in later parts of the program.  This can lead to unexpected errors or application crashes. The solution demonstrates how to correctly handle this using Promises or async/await.

## Bug Report

The main problem is that the asynchronous operation of getting data from Firebase might not finish before the rest of the code runs. This can lead to unexpected errors because you might be using data before it has been properly loaded. 

## Solution

The solution uses Promises to ensure that all the data is loaded before the rest of the code runs.
